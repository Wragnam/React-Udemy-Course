This is the code and content that was done while I was working though the React course.

To run any of the sections and work with it:
1) cd into any of the sections
2) In the terminal run npm install
3) If there is a backend folder you need to cd into that folder in another terminal as well
4) Run npm install in the backend folders as well
5) Run the backend code with "node app.js" in the terminal
6) Run the main project with either "npm run dev" or npm start.
